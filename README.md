# Algorithms

#### Overview:

---

Implementations of advanced tree structures, priority queues, heaps, directed and undirected graphs. Advanced searching and sorting (radix sort, heap sort, merge sort, and quicksort). Design and analysis of data structures and algorithms. Divide-and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming algorithm design techniques.

#### Outcomes:

---

- Analyze the running time of algorithms using asymptotic notation
- Implement search trees, heaps, and graphs and use these data structures in programs they design
- Perform breadth-first search and depth-first search
- Use advanced sorting techniques
- Solve recurrence relations representing the running time of an algorithm designed using a divide-and- conquer strategy
- Comprehend the basic concept of NP-completeness and realize that they may not be able to efficiently solve all problems they encounter in their careers
- Comprehend algorithms designed using greedy, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming techniques
